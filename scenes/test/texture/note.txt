the abstraction is good but somehow so shitty
i dont know how to say this
cant easily implement a texture inside a bsdf
and the mesh automatic generate a diffuse bsdf if none is assigned , i mean i gonna remove this soon


so i have to explicit declare a bsdf for area light type (which so shitty i know)
the rendering time is longer a bit, i don't know if just the scene or i do sth wrong af (maybe cuz the scene too difuse)
